# Face_Recognition_Human_Vision

UpdatedEccentricityCNN.py -> To get the top 5 test accuracy for the dataset specified.
                             Run the code using command python3 UpdatedEccentricityCNN.py.
                             Before running the code mention the train and test dataset directory as given below in the code                                dataSet_directory = 'train_data'
                             testData_directory2 ='test_data1'
                             testData_directory3 ='test_data2'
                             testData_directory4 = 'test_data3'
                             testData_directory5 = 'test_data4'
                             
                             "dataSet_directory" contains the directory on which the model is trained leaving apart 20% as test                               data
                             "testData_directory2","testData_directory3","testData_directory4","testData_directory5" contains                                 differently scaled and shifted version of the faces on which the trained model is tested.
                             
                              The final result is the top 5 test accuracy for each of the different version of faces.
